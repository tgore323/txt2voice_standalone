# txt2voice_standalone
A version of my program, txt2voice, except this is a stand alone executable. 

This is alpha software, so it might not work or it might break shit. You've been warned.

The only requirement for linux based systems is ffmpeg. On Ubuntu/Debian/Linux Mint based computers, type the following into a terminal window to install ffmpeg:

<code>sudo apt-get install ffmpeg</code>
